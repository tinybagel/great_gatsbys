## AJA&D Doodles and Unfinished Projects
Straight from my notebooks, be inspired by goofy drawings of mermaids, cutesy couples, or doggos! I also have unfinished projects on here; they may be later categorized in other areas on the site when finished. This part of the site will constantly be re-invented, so be sure to save your favorites... or not. You do you, boo.

>MCU Friend Crossover Sketches. Cosplay ideas and cartoon doodles combined. My favorite Dork as Captain America, me as Bucky Barnes, Mulligan as Spidey, and my sister as Hawkeye/Kate Bishop.
